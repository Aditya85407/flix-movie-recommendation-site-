# flix-movie-recommendation-site-
Flix is a modern and responsive movie recommendation website designed to help users quickly discover trending, top-rated, and genre-based movies. Powered by the TMDB API, the platform provides real-time movie data, an elegant UI, and a seamless browsing experience similar to an OTT platform. Users can search for movies, explore categories, view detailed descriptions, and receive suggestions based on what they are watching.

Built using React, the app follows a clean component-based architecture with smooth navigation through React Router and efficient API handling via Axios. The site is optimized for both mobile and desktop screens, ensuring a fast and intuitive user experience. The project reflects strong frontend engineering skills, API integration, and UI/UX planning.

Planned future enhancements include user authentication, personal watchlists, improved recommendation logic, and trailer support—turning Flix into a more personalized movie discovery platform.
